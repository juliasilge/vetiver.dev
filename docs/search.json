A VetiverModel collects all the information needed for deploying a trained model, while a VetiverAPI deploys the model to a REST endpoint.

This ptype is an automatically created Pydantic BaseModel that stores the types of the data that the API can expect when deployed. To enable this feature, set save_ptype = True and set ptype_data equal to training data. You can turn this feature off by setting save_ptype = False and not passing in any ptype_data."

This is an optional configuration, but it creates more verbose documentation within the API, as well as allows for some basic type-checking within the API itself. To turn this off, set `save_ptype = False`.\nIn the output, there will be a line with something similar to:\nINFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)\nFollow the link to the API at http://127.0.0.1:8000. You will be redirected to the automatic API documentation provided by Rapidoc. From there, you can send requests to your model, see example curl commands, and interact with your API."
